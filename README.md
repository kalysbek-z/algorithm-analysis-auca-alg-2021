# algorithm analysis auca course works
This course is continuation of data structures course
My labs/homeworks/projects of this course:
* basics of C++/C
* simple implementations of linked list, binary search tree, map, hashset with unit testing
* learning recursion, backtracking
* sorting, searching algorithms
* learning basic data structures (arrays,linked lists , trees, hash tables, graphs)
* solving problems (UVA) using data structures (C++ stl library), recursion and graphs
